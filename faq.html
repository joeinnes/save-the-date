            <summary class="font-1">Can I bring my children?</summary>
            <p>
              Yes! Children are welcome at the wedding, and will be listed on
              your invitation. Be aware that although Budapest is very safe, the
              area immediately outside the venue is publicly accessible, so
              children should be supervised. We are planning to help with this
              for at least some of the event.
            </p>
            <p>
              We would also ask that children stay quiet during the
              ceremony&mdash;otherwise we'd ask you to pop outside with them
              until they've calmed down.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary class="font-1">Can I take photos?</summary>
            <p>
              We'd love you to take photos! After the wedding, we'll share a
              link where you can share your best pictures with us and the other
              wedding-goers. We'd rather you didn't upload any photos to social
              media.
            </p>
            <p>
              We would however ask you to <strong>avoid</strong> taking photos
              during the ceremony itself&mdash;we've paid for professional
              photographers, and we'd rather they didn't miss the shot because
              someone else's camera got in the way!

          <details>
            <summary class="font-1">Where can I stay?</summary>
            <p>
              We'll be sharing accommodation suggestions shortly.

          <details>
            <summary class="font-1">Will my Uber work?</summary>
            <p>
              Unfortunately, Uber has been chased out of Hungary, but there is a
              similar app called <a href="https://bolt.eu/">Bolt</a>. It's fast,
              relatively cheap, and works pretty well.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary class="font-1">What drinks will be available?</summary>
            <p>
              Soft drinks (fizzy, mineral water, coffee, fruit juice) will be
              available all night. There will also be an open bar with local
              Hungarian beers (unfiltered light beer, dark beer) and
              alcohol-free Heineken, as well as a selection of high-quality
              Hungarian wines.
            </p>
            <p>
              Hungary has a fantastic climate and soil for growing wine, and the
              quality and standard of Hungarian wines is very good.
            </p>
          </details>
          <details>
            <summary class="font-1">Do I need a car?</summary>
            <p>
              Almost certainly not. The event itself is easy to get to by
              walking (approx 10-15 minutes from nearest public transport
              stops), or by taxi. Budapest itself is a very good value place to
              stay, and the public transport system is very effective and fast.
            </p>

          <details>
            <summary class="font-1">What should I see around the city?</summary>
            <p>
              There are loads of cool things to see and do around the city. We'd
              recommend going up Gellert Hill, taking a trip to the Castle
              district, visiting the infamous Szimpla kert. The Parliament
              building is also very impressive If you find yourself with a bit
              of time on your hands, pop down to Margaret Island, and wander
              around the gardens a bit.
